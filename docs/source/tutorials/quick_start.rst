Quick Start
==================

Create a tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily create a tree value object based on `FastTreeValue`.

.. literalinclude:: create_a_tree.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The result should be

.. literalinclude:: create_a_tree.demo.py.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:

A simple tree value structure is created successfully.

Edit the tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the tree is created, you can access and edit it with `__getitem__`, `__setitem__` and `__delitem__`.

.. literalinclude:: edit_tree.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The result should be

.. literalinclude:: edit_tree.demo.py.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:

The values on the tree has been changed or deleted properly.
