Quick Start
==================

Create a Simplest Tree
-------------------------------------

You can create a simplest tree like this

.. literalinclude:: create_a_tree.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

A tree value object with the following structure will be \
created

.. image:: simple_demo.dat.svg
    :align: center

The output of the code above should be

.. literalinclude:: create_a_tree.demo.py.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:


Create a Slightly Complex Tree
-------------------------------------

You can easily create a tree value object which is \
slightly complex, based on ``FastTreeValue``.

.. literalinclude:: create_a_complex_tree.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The result should be

.. literalinclude:: create_a_complex_tree.demo.py.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:

Three simple treevalue structures are created. \
Then save the code above to ``demo.py``, and then input \
this shell command in your terminal.

.. literalinclude:: display_complex_tree.demo.sh
    :language: shell
    :linenos:

A graph named ``demo.dat.svg`` will be generated, like this.

.. image:: complex_demo.dat.svg
    :align: center

Now you are successfully started.
