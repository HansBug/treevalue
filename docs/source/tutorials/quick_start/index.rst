Quick Start
==================

Create a tree
-----------------

You can easily create a tree value object based on ``FastTreeValue``.

.. literalinclude:: create_a_tree.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The result should be

.. literalinclude:: create_a_tree.demo.py.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:

Three simple treevalue structures are created. \
Then save the code above to ``demo.py``, and then input \
this shell command in your terminal.

.. literalinclude:: display_this_tree.demo.sh
    :language: shell
    :linenos:

A graph named ``demo.dat.svg`` will be generated, like this.

.. image:: demo.dat.svg
    :align: center

Now you are successfully started.
