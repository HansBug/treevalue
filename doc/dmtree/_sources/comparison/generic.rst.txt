What and Why to Compare
====================================

In this part, TreeValue will be compared with several different similar libraries \
in terms of functionality and performance. It contains the following sections:

* Run Environment Information
* Comparison to DM-Tree

More comparison will be take out soon.

.. note::
    Please note that **the core advantage of treevalue is actually \
    to model and simplify the writing process of programs, \
    not to provide higher computing performance**. \
    In fact, in large-scale operations, the performance advantage of treevalue \
    will tend to be marginal. Therefore, this part of the comparison will not only \
    focus on the performance differences, but will also briefly discuss \
    the capabilities and potential of the different libraries.
