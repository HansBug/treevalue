Quick Start
==================

Create a tree
-----------------

You can easily create a tree value object based on ``FastTreeValue``.

.. literalinclude:: create_a_tree.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The result should be

.. literalinclude:: create_a_tree.demo.py.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:

A simple tree value structure is created successfully with the structure below.

.. image:: create_a_tree.gv.svg
    :align: center

Now you are successfully started.
