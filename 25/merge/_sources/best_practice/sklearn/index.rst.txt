Apply into Scikit-Learn
===========================

Actually, ``TreeValue`` can be used in practice with not only ``numpy`` or ``torch`` library, such as ``scikit-learn``.
In the following part, a demo of PCA to tree-structured arrays will be shown.

We can do this with the following code

.. literalinclude:: sklearn.demo.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

The output should be

.. literalinclude:: sklearn.demo.py.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:
